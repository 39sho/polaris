Layouts sections come in three main configurations. one-column, two-column, and annotated. One and two column layouts can be combined in the same page. Annotated layouts should be used on their own and only on settings pages.\ncategory: Layout and structure\nkeywords:\n- one column\n- two column\n- three column\n- column\n- annotated\n- page\n- column layouts\n- containers\n- full width containers\n- secondary sections\n- setting page\n- grouped sections\n- annotated sections\nexamples:\n- fileName: layout-one-column.tsx\ntitle: One-column\ndescription: Use to have a single section on its own in a full-width container. Use for simple pages and as a container for banners and other full-width content.\n- fileName: layout-two-columns-with-primary-and-secondary-widths.tsx\ntitle: Two columns with primary and secondary widths\ndescription: Use to follow a normal section with a secondary section to create a 2/3 + 1/3 layout on detail pages (such as individual product or order pages). Can also be used on any page that needs to structure a lot of content. This layout stacks the columns on small screens.\n- fileName: layout-two-columns-with-equal-width.tsx\ntitle: Two columns with equal width\ndescription: Use to create a ½ + ½ layout. Can be used to display content of equal importance. This layout will stack the columns on small screens.\n- fileName: layout-three-columns-with-equal-width.tsx\ntitle: Three columns with equal width\ndescription: Use to create a ⅓ + ⅓ + ⅓ layout. Can be used to display content of equal importance. This layout will stack the columns on small screens.\n- fileName: layout-annotated.tsx\ntitle: Annotated\ndescription: Use for settings pages. When settings are grouped thematically in annotated sections, the title and description on each section helps merchants quickly find the setting they’re looking for.\n- fileName: layout-annotated-with-sections.tsx\ntitle: Annotated with sections\ndescription: Use for settings pages. When settings are grouped thematically in annotated sections, the title and description on each section helps merchants quickly find the setting they’re looking for.\n- fileName: layout-annotated-with-banner-at-the-top.tsx\ntitle: Annotated with Banner at the top\ndescription: Use for settings pages that need a banner or other content at the top.\n---\n\n## Best practices\n\nThe layout component should:\n\n- Use sections with white backgrounds for primary content and sections with grey backgrounds for secondary content that is less important\n- Center cards on the background when there is no secondary card on the page to stop the content from becoming too wide\n- Group similar concepts and actions together in cards\n- Separate different cards using a full-width divider\n- Structure primary/secondary, two-column layouts so the primary ⅔ section is used for main information and the secondary ⅓ section is used for information that might not be used as often but remains helpful for context or secondary tasks\n- Use equal-width layouts with two or more columns when each layout section has the same importance\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\nThe content that appears in the layout component comes from cards and annotated sections.\n\n### Cards\n\nContent from cards should follow the content guidelines for [cards](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/alpha-card#content-guidelines).\n\n### Annotated section titles\n\nAnnotated section titles should follow the content guidelines for [headings and subheadings](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#headings-and-subheadings).\n\n### Annotated section descriptions\n\nAnnotated section descriptions should:\n\n- Be used if the explanation or purpose of the associated cards isn’t clear\n- Provide instructions for any choices merchants need to make, or explain the purpose of the section\n- Be short, no more than 1–3 sentences\n- Direct merchants to more content in the Help Center with “Learn more” links\n- Not repeat the section title\n- Use complete sentences and regular punctuation\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To visually group content in a layout section, [use the card component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/alpha-card)\n- To lay out a set of smaller
