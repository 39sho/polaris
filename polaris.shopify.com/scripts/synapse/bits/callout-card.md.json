Don’t use permissive language like “you can”.\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\nGet performance data for all your sales channels.\n\n#### Don’t\n\nNow you can get performance data for all your sales channels.\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n- Structured for merchant success: always put the most critical information first\n- Clear: use the verb “need” to help merchants understand when they’re required to do something\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\nTo buy a shipping label, you need to enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.\n\n#### Don’t\n\nTo buy a shipping label, you must enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n### Call to action\n\nButtons should be:\n\nClear and predictable: merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button. Never deceive merchants by mislabeling a button.\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\nBuy shipping label\n\n#### Don’t\n\nBuy\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n- Action-led: buttons should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action. To provide enough context to merchants use the {verb}+{noun} format on buttons except in the case of common actions like Save, Close, Cancel, or OK.\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\nView shipping settings\n\n#### Don’t\n\nView your settings\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n- Scannable: avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\nAdd menu item\n\n#### Don’t\n\nAdd a menu item\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To group similar concepts and tasks together, [use the card component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/alpha-card)\n- To create page-level layout, [use the layout component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/layout)\n- To explain a feature that merchants haven’t tried yet, [use the empty state component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/empty-state)\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe required `title` prop gives the callout card a level 2 heading (`<h2>`). This helps with readability and provides structure to screen reader users.\n\nIllustrations included in callout cards are implemented as decorative images with empty `alt` attributes (`alt=\"\"` ) so that they’re skipped by screen readers.\n\nUse [actionable language](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#navigation) to ensure that the purpose of the callout card is clear to all merchants, including those with issues related to reading and
