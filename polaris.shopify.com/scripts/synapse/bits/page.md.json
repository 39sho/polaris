Actions marked external open in a new browser tab.\n- fileName: page-without-pagination.tsx\ntitle: Without pagination\ndescription: Use when the page doesn’t represent a list of objects or a detail view for an object.\n- fileName: page-full-width.tsx\ntitle: Full-width\ndescription: Use for layouts that benefit from more screen width, such as wide tables or lists.\n- fileName: page-narrow-width.tsx\ntitle: Narrow width\ndescription: Use a narrow width layout if the page supports a single unified task. When merchants must review the entire page contents to complete their goal, this layout helps focus their attention in a single path from top to bottom.\n- fileName: page-with-action-groups.tsx\ntitle: With action groups\ndescription: Use action groups for sets of actions that relate to one another, particularly when there are too many to display as secondary actions. Note that these groups will be further rolled up into a single action for smaller displays so that actions do not wrap or overflow the page bounds.\n- fileName: page-with-content-after-title.tsx\ntitle: With content after title\ndescription: Title metadata appears immediately after the page’s title. Use it to communicate brief, important and non-interactive status information about an entire page.\n- fileName: page-with-divider.tsx\ntitle: With divider\ndescription: Use when the page needs visual separation between the page header and the content.\n---\n\n## Best practices\n\nThe page component should:\n\n- Always provide a title for the page header.\n- Always provide breadcrumbs when a page has a parent page.\n- Be organized around a primary activity. If that primary activity is a single action, provide it as a primary button in the page header.\n- Provide other page-level actions as secondary actions in the page header.\n- When the page represents an object of a certain type, provide pagination links to the previous and next object of the same type.\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\n### Title\n\nTitles should:\n\n- Describe the page in as few words as possible.\n- Be the name of the object type (pluralized) when the page is a list of objects. For a list of orders, the page title should be “Orders”.\n- Not be truncated.\n\n### App icon\n\nApp icons should:\n\n- Provide their app icon\n- Only be provided for pages that are part of a Shopify app\n\n### Breadcrumbs\n\nThe content of each breadcrumb link should be the title of the page to which it links.\n\n### Page header actions\n\nPage header action labels should be:\n\n- Clear and predictable: merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a page action. Never deceive merchants by mislabeling an action.\n\n- Action-led: they should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action. To provide enough context to merchants, use the {verb}+{noun} format.\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\n- Create order\n- View in Postmates\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Create\n- Postmates deliveries\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n- Short: for secondary actions, when the noun represents the same object as the page itself, a verb alone may be used. If there is ambiguity (such as with the verb “Cancel”), always use the {verb}+{noun} format.\n\nIn the context of the orders list page:\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\n- Import\n- Export\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Import orders\n- Export orders\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n- Scannable: avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\nAdd menu item\n\n#### Don’t\n\nAdd a menu item\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To lay out the content within a page, use the [layout
