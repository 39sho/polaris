This is an opportunity to provide explanation or guidance to help merchants progress. The empty state component is intended for use when a full page in the admin is empty, and not for individual elements or areas in the interface.\ncategory: Layout and structure\nkeywords:\n- EmptyState\n- lander\n- welcome\n- explain features\n- describe features\n- educate about features\n- merchant education\n- educational opportunity\n- educational opportunities\n- illustration on pages\n- empty layouts\n- empty states\n- starting pages\n- starting layouts\n- educating\n- teaching\n- landing pages\n- landing layouts\nexamples:\n- fileName: empty-state-default.tsx\ntitle: Default\ndescription: Use to explain a single feature before merchants have used it.\n- fileName: empty-state-with-subdued-footer-context.tsx\ntitle: With subdued footer context\ndescription: Use to provide additional but non-critical context for a new product or feature.

They should:\n\n- Describe or explain what’s in the empty state title or item title\n- Be conversational: include articles such as the, a, and an\n\n### Primary action\n\nButtons are used for the most important actions you want merchants to take.\nThey should be:\n\n- Clear and predictable: merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button. Never deceive merchants by using misleading titles.\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\n- Create order\n- Buy shipping label\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- New order\n- Buy\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n- Action-led: buttons should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action. To provide enough context to merchants use the {verb}+{noun} format on buttons except in the case of common actions like Save, Close, Cancel, or OK.\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\n- Activate Apple Pay\n- View shipping settings\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Try Apple Pay\n- View your settings\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n- Scannable: avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\n- Add menu item\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Add a menu item\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n### Secondary action\n\nSecondary actions are used for less important actions such as “Learn more” or “Close” buttons. They should follow all the other content rules outlined for primary buttons.\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To learn more about illustrations for empty states, [read the illustration
