There is padding of `space-5` (20px) around children and `space-4` (16px) for small screens.\n- fileName: alpha-card-with-subdued-background.tsx\ntitle: With subdued background\ndescription: >-\nUse for content that you want to deprioritize. Subdued cards don’t stand out as much as cards with white backgrounds so don’t use them for information or actions that are critical to merchants.\n- fileName: alpha-card-with-varying-padding.tsx\ntitle: With varying padding\ndescription: >-\nUse the `padding` property to adjust the spacing of content within a card. The `padding` prop supports responsive spacing with the [Breakpoints tokens](https://polaris.shopify.com/tokens/breakpoints).\n- fileName: alpha-card-with-rounded-corners.tsx\ntitle: Rounded corners\ndescription: >-\nCards can have a border radius applied responsively with the `roundedAbove` prop.\n---\n\n## Best practices\n\nCards should:\n\n- Group related information\n- Display information in a way that prioritizes what the merchant needs to know most first\n- Use headings that set clear expectations about the card’s purpose\n- Stick to single user flows or break more complicated flows into multiple sections\n- Avoid too many call-to-action buttons or links and only one primary call to action per card\n- Use calls to action on the bottom of the card for next steps and use the space in the upper right corner of the card for persistent, optional actions (such as Edit)\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- For more flexibility on styling, [use the Box
