Visual media is used to provide additional context to the written information it's paired with.\ncategory: Layout and structure\nkeywords:\n- MediaCard\n- actionable\n- updates\n- new features\n- Media card\n- image card\n- feature card\n- card with thumbnail\n- thumbnail card\nexamples:\n- fileName: media-card-default.tsx\ntitle: Default\ndescription: Use to surface educational information about a feature or opportunity.\n- fileName: media-card-with-small-visual.tsx\ntitle: With small visual\ndescription: Use when there are limited vertical space, or when the card should be less prominent.\n- fileName: media-card-with-secondary-action.tsx\ntitle: With secondary action\ndescription: Use when there are two distinct actions merchants can take on the information in the card.\n- fileName: media-card-with-no-actions.tsx\ntitle: With no actions\ndescription: Use when media card does not require any actions.\n- fileName: media-card-video-card.tsx\ntitle: Video card\ndescription: Use to provide a consistent layout for contextual learning content.

For example, in an empty state.\n---\n\n## Best practices\n\nMedia cards should:\n\n- Provide merchants with a clear call to action.\n- Always pair text with a visual component, for example, body text paired with an image, video, etc.\n- Use media to enhance the written content. The written content should be able to stand alone without an explanation from the paired media.\n- Show targeted content toward specific audiences to maximize relevance.\n- Be dismissable.\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\n- Don’t use media cards as advertisements for your feature. Instead they should educate the merchant about how to accomplish tasks related to the section they’re in.\n\n### Title\n\nMedia card titles should follow the content guidelines for [headings and subheadings](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#headings-and-subheadings).\n\n### Body content\n\nBody content should be:\n\n- Actionable: start sentences with imperative verbs when telling merchants what actions are available to them, especially something new. Don’t use permissive language like “you can”.\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\nGet performance data for all of your sales channels.\n\n#### Don’t\n\nNow you can get performance data for all of your sales channels.\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n- Structured for merchant success: always put the most critical information first\n- Clear: use the verb “need” to help merchants understand when they’re required to do something\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\nTo buy a shipping label, you need to enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.\n\n#### Don’t\n\nTo buy a shipping label, you must enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n### Call to action\n\nButtons should be:\n\nClear and predictable: merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button. Never deceive merchants by mislabeling a button.\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\nBuy shipping label\n\n#### Don’t\n\nBuy\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n- Action-led: buttons should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action. To provide enough context to merchants use the {verb}+{noun} format on buttons except in the case of common actions like Save, Close, Cancel, or OK.\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\nView shipping settings\n\n#### Don’t\n\nView your settings\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n- Scannable: avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n#### Do\n\nAdd menu item\n\n#### Don’t\n\nAdd a menu item\n\n<!-- end -->\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To create a video card, [use the video thumbnail component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/video-thumbnail)\n- To group similar concepts and tasks together, [use the card component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/alpha-card)\n- To create page-level layout, [use the layout component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/layout)\n- To explain a feature that merchants haven’t tried yet, [use the empty state component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/empty-state)\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe required `title` prop gives the media card a level 2 heading (`<h2>`). This helps with readability and provides structure to screen reader users. It can also accept a ReactNode.\n\nUse [actionable language](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#navigation) to ensure that the purpose of the media card is clear to all merchants, including those with issues related to reading and
