## What we want

- Learning the pattern
  - What's important when implementing this pattern
  - Why's the pattern important
  - When should we use this pattern?
- Principle first, then extrapolate/explain technical decisions from there.

## What we don't

- Learning Javascript
- Learning Polaris
- Learning React

## Things to consider

- Working with technical writers
- Maybe chatGPT can facilitate if we can't get a technical writer

## Learnings:

- There's no one size fit all solution for this
- Truly longform content
- Challenge is how we make this workload manageable for
  a) the team
  b) future contributors
