# Working with the Polaris team

When you contribute to Polaris, you help the Shopify community create better experiences for merchants, faster. Contribution takes thoughtful planning. Through supporting teams, we’ve learned what works well, and not so well. We’ve outlined these things so that you can create a successful plan. This guide goes into detail, but here are the highlights:

- - High pressure deadlines are stressful, but the Polaris team can’t be pulled in to unblock. Think about the system early in the design process and plan for any system updates or additions ahead of the build stage. The Polaris team is here to support you while planning. Start a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/discussions/6750) for a larger contribution. For smaller contributions like bug fixes, read the [contribution guide](/contributing).
For the system to stay healthy and scale, contributions require a certain level of [quality](/contributing/quality-contributions)
 -If you make a custom solution, your team is responsible for maintaining it. Be aware of the impact if other teams use or tweak your already custom solution. Always use Polaris tokens. Learn more about [when to make a contribution](/contributing/#when-to-contribute) vs a custom solution. 
- The best way to get support is to start a [Github discussion](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/discussions/6750) or reach out in the #polaris channel (if you are a Shopify employee). Please avoid direct messaging Polaris team members about a system inquiry. 

Our community is important to us. For our community support to scale, we rely on operations that distribute our efforts, while also giving us time to work on system projects. We lean on asynchronous collaboration as much as possible since our team is internationally distributed. Here’s how we mainly provide support:

- Through a support rotation during working hours. The scheduled support pair monitors the internal #polaris Slack channel and [Github](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris), and makes an effort to respond within 24 hours for inquiries and 72 hours for collaboration requests
- Ad hoc pairing sessions and asynchronous collaboration for system contributions

## Polaris on-call support

The Polaris team rotation schedule assigns one UXer and one developer to cover system inquiries and collaboration requests—coverage is during their distributed working hours, Monday to Friday. The pair on rotation:
- Directs internal #polaris Slack questions to a resolution
- Directs large requests for collaboration to @polaris-enablement for triaging		
- Reviews, cleans up, or closes GitHub issues
- Provide PR reviews where necessary
- Participates in GitHub discussions where necessary
- Monitors internal #admin-ux for Polaris design system related questions or inquiries

If an issue doesn’t get resolved by the end of their work day, it’s passed along to the next scheduled support pair.

If a Polaris team member is individually DM’d, they’ill forward the inquiry/request to the internal #polaris channel for the pair on call to respond.

## Response time goals

## Product team considerations 

### Plan for systems changes ahead of time

Teams at Shopify should start working on their system needs early in the design and build process and are expected to make [quality system contributions](link to new quality guidelines) ahead of their ship dates. The Polaris team should never be pulled in to unblock a team from shipping something quickly. The Polaris team is here to support and guide teams when they’re planning their strategic system changes ahead of time. 

### Aim to systematize your custom solutions
Things don’t always go according to plan. If a team is still learning how to plan for system changes and finds themselves under pressure to ship something custom quickly, they’re responsible for owning their custom components. The components should use [Polaris tokens](https://polaris.shopify.com/tokens/colors) and they should make an effort to systematize the custom solution down the road. When product-wide changes happen in the future, the product team will be responsible for updating their custom components and any other places where their custom solution is copied to other features.
